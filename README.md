# my_environments


Here I save all the .yml files for creating conda python environments for specific tasks.
They work for MacBook Apple M2 Max MacOS Sonoma Version 14.0


## env_kalpana_v1 
Kalpana: [https://github.com/largeseabass/Kalpana](https://github.com/largeseabass/Kalpana) 


## analysis
I run almost all my tasks under this environment, if not otherwise specified.


## gdal
Since this package sometimes messes up others, I keep it separate.
